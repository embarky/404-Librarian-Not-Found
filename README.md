# 404-Librarian-Not-Found ( It’s AI Now )
The project is setup as a Kaggle competition, but this is only one aspect of the full project. You should also develop an independent application using Streamlit, where you use your predictive model and showcase your solution.

(3 people per team) Your report is your README.md of your github page. It should contain your results, your rank in the competition, your UI/demo, and a video where you showcase your solution (no need to show code).

## Evaluation:
- Kaggle Rank
- Code quality (using classes, splitting into proper files, documentation, etc)
- User interface and application that you create based on the model (use streamlit for that)
- Github quality (include link to video, table with progress over time, organization of code, images, etc)
- Presentation / Video quality (good slides, interesting presentation).
